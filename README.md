* **query_file**: File path to read queries to search. Used with `run_ad_clicker.py` and `run_in_loop.py`. Put a query for each line.

* **proxy_file**: File path to read proxies. Put a proxy for each line.

* **user_agents**: File path to read user agents. Default value is `user_agents.txt`.

* **filtered_domains**: File path to read domains to filter for clicking non-ad links. Default value is `domains.txt` in the project directory. If you don't want to filter non-ad domains, simply leave the `domains.txt` file empty and 3 links will be randomly selected.

* **proxy**: Use the given proxy with `ad_clicker.py`. The `proxy_file` and `proxy` parameters can not have a value at the same time.

* **auth**: Use proxy with username and password. If this is `true`, your proxies should be in `username:password@host:port` format

    > **Important Note:** Starting from Chrome 142, Google removed `--load-extension` argument that disables the ability to install
        plugins programmatically. Please make this parameter `false` and use your proxies in `IP:PORT` format with ip authentication
        method by whitelisting your IP on your proxy provider. Otherwise, you won't be able to use authenticated proxies.

* **incognito**: Run in incognito mode. Note that the proxy extension is not enabled in `incognito` mode.

* **country_domain**: Set opening URL based on the proxy country.

* **language_from_proxy**: Set browser locale language based on the proxy country.

* **ss_on_exception**: Enable taking screenshot in case of an exception.

* **window_size**: Set browser window size as `width,height` px.

* **shift_windows**: Shift browser windows by randomly selected x,y offsets.
    * If you are using a display zoom other than 100%, use this together with `window_size` option.
    * If a custom `window_size` is given, it is used to determine a new widthxheight for the window. Otherwise, screen resolution is used.

* **use_seleniumbase**: Use SeleniumBase with UC mode instead of undetected_chromedriver.

* **query**: Search query. The `query_file` and `query` parameters can not have a value at the same time.
    * A query like "wireless speaker@amazon#ebay  # mediamarkt" searches for "wireless speaker" and click links that include the given filter words in url or title.

    * Spaces around "@" and "#" are ignored, so both "wireless speaker@amazon#ebay" and
    "wireless speaker @ amazon  # ebay" take "wireless speaker" as search query and "amazon" and "ebay" as filter words.

    * If you will give a target domain as filter word, don't use "http" or "www" parts in it. Use like "query@domainname.com" or even "query@domainname". Keep it as short as possible to get a match.

* **ad_page_min_wait**: Number of minimum seconds to wait on the ad page. The value is randomly selected between the min/max ranges.
* **ad_page_max_wait**: Number of maximum seconds to wait on the ad page. The value is randomly selected between the min/max ranges.
* **nonad_page_min_wait**: Number of minimum seconds to wait on the non-ad page. The value is randomly selected between the min/max ranges.
* **nonad_page_max_wait**: Number of maximum seconds to wait on the non-ad page. The value is randomly selected between the min/max ranges.

* **max_scroll_limit**: Number of maximum scrolls on the search results page. It will scroll until the end of the page by default(0).

* **check_shopping_ads**: Enable checking and clicking shopping ads seen on top up to 5 if exists. It is more likely to see shopping ads if you use residential proxies.

* **excludes**: Exclude the ads that contain given words in url or title.
    * A value like "amazon.com,mediamarkt.com,for 2022,Soundbar" click links except the ones containing the given words in url or title.
    * Separate multiple exclude items with comma.

* **random_mouse**: Enable random mouse movements on pages.

* **custom_cookies**: Use custom collected cookies. They should be put into `cookies.txt` file in the project directory.

* **click_order**: Click order for ad and non-ad links found
    * 1: click all non-ad links first, then click ad links
    * 2: click all ad links first, then non-ad links
    * 3: click 1 non-ad, then 1 ad, then all remaining non-ads, finally all remaining ads
    * 4: click 1 non-ad, then 1 ad on each round
    * 5: shuffle ad and non-ad links and click whichever order is created (default)

* **browser_count**: Maximum number of browsers to run concurrently. Used with `run_ad_clicker.py` and `run_in_loop.py`.
    * If the value is 0, the number of cpu cores is used.

* **multiprocess_style**: Style of the multiprocess run. Used with `run_ad_clicker.py` and `run_in_loop.py`.
    * 1: different query on each browser (default)
        * e.g. First, queries in the file are shuffled. Then, 5 browsers search the first 5 queries from the file.
    * 2: same query on each browser
        * e.g. 5 browsers search the first query from file. After they are completed, second group of 5 browsers search the second query and so on.

    * If the number of queries or proxies are less than the number of browsers to run, they are cycled.
    * If *multiprocess_style* is 1, queries read from the file are shuffled.

* **loop_wait_time**: Wait time between runs in seconds. Default is 60. Used with `run_in_loop.py`.

* **wait_factor**: Wait factor to modify all sleeps except loop wait. The default value is 1.0.
    * For example, if you want to decrease waits by half, you can set this to 0.5, or if you want to increase them by 30%, you can use this as 1.3.
    * Note that especially with decreasing, it can make the tool faster but can not guarantee proper functioning.

* **running_interval_start**: Running interval start in "HH:MM" format. Used with `run_in_loop.py`.
    * If the current time is outside of the interval, it waits the start time to run again.
* **running_interval_end**: Running interval end in "HH:MM" format. Used with `run_in_loop.py`.
    * Difference between start and end time must be at least 10 minutes.
    * If both start and end is "00:00"(default), no interval check is done.

* **2captcha_apikey**: API key for 2captcha service.
    * Note that this is a 3rd party service, so you need to [register with it](https://2captcha.com/?from=18906047) to get an API key.

* **hooks_enabled**: Enable hooks for extending the tool with custom behavior.
    * You can implement the functions in the `hooks.py` module as your need.
    * Any errors coming from your custom implementation will be in your responsibility.
    * Installing additional 3rd-party packages used in your implementation is in your responsibility.

* **telegram_enabled**: Enable Telegram notifications.
    * You will get a message like below.

        ![telegram_message](assets/telegram_message.png)

    * There is a limit of 2048 characters. If the length of the message exceeds this, it will be truncated.

* **send_to_android**: Send links to open on connected Android mobile device. Used with `run_ad_clicker.py` and `run_in_loop.py`.

    * Note that mobile device must be connected to the same wireless network or directly via USB cable for one of these usages.

    * If you have less devices(n) than browsers you run, first n browsers will be assigned to n devices.

    * ADB setup steps
        1. Open your phone’s **Settings**.
        2. Scroll down to **About phone**.
        3. Find **Build number** (usually under Software Information).
        4. Tap Build number 7 times. You should see a message like "You are now a developer!"
        5. Go back to Settings, and you will now see a **Developer options** menu.
        6. Open **Developer options** and enable **USB Debugging**.

## Troubleshooting

#### 1. ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

* If you see this error, run the following commands.

    1. Delete `.MULTI_BROWSERS_IN_USE` file if exists.
        * `rm .MULTI_BROWSERS_IN_USE` for Linux or `del .MULTI_BROWSERS_IN_USE` for Windows.

    2. Run `python ad_clicker.py -q test` and end it by pressing CTRL+C after seeing the browser opened.

    3. Continue with one of the commands from [How to run](#how-to-run) section.

#### 2. Chrome version mismatch error

* If you get an error like **"This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version ... Current browser version is ..."**, it means you are using an older Chrome version and should update to the latest one.

* You may need to apply [solution from the previous section](#1-valueerror-max-arg-is-an-empty-sequence) for some cases.
